# Google-Playstore-Crawler
This web crawler developed using Python 2.7 using Scrapy (for crawling web) and Flask (for web service)

This script is no longer working because Google has changed their html elements. If you are interested how I did it, you can read my journal paper here http://jurnal.fikom.umi.ac.id/index.php/ILKOM/article/view/282
